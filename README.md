## Deploying to Render

This guide will walk you through deploying your Express.js application to Render. Follow the steps below to get your app up and running.

### Prerequisites

- A built Express.js project ready for deployment.
- A GitHub repository containing your Express.js app.
- A Render account (sign up at [render.com](https://render.com/)).

### Steps to Deploy

1. **Push Your Code to a Git Repository**
   Ensure your Express.js app is pushed to your GitHub repository:

   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-express-app.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Sign Up or Log In to Render**
   Go to [Render](https://render.com/) and log in to your account.

3. **Create a New Web Service**
   - Click on **"New"** and select **"Web Service"**.
   - Connect your GitHub account and select the repository containing your Express.js app.

4. **Configure Service Settings**
   - Choose a name for your service.
   - Select the branch you want to deploy (usually `main`).
   - Set the **Environment** to **Node**.

5. **Set Environment Variables**
   In the "Environment" section, add the required environment variables:

   | Key              | Value                  |
   | ---------------- | ---------------------- |
   | `PRIVATE_KEY`    | (Your private key)     |
   | `DATABASE_URL`   | (Your database URL)    |
   | `FRONTEND_URL`   | (Your frontend URL)    |

   You can add these variables by clicking on **"Add Environment Variable"**.

6. **Specify the Start Command**
   Render automatically detects your start command from your `package.json` file. Ensure you have a `start` script defined. It should look something like this:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "start": "node index.js" // or your entry file
   }
   ```

7. **Deploy the Project**
   - Click the **"Create Web Service"** button. Render will start building and deploying your app.
   - You can monitor the deployment process in the Render dashboard.

### Access Your App

Once the deployment is complete, Render will provide a live URL where your Express.js app is hosted. You can access it through the provided URL.
